# Bruno Alves

A brazilian **Front End Engineer** based in Porto, Portugal.

I'm focus on web development and design product page, I am passionate about creating digital products with attention to visual aspects and user experience.

Actually, I'm working mostly with React, Next, TypeScript and occasionally I take the time to practice some Python code or build something fun with JavaScript or that I feel like playing with right away.
